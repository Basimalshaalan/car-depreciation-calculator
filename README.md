# car-depreciation-calculator

## Next steps:

1. Replace the "Lorem ipsum..." text with a short one sentence description of how the user can use this website.
2. For now, since this is a simple project, delete the "Make section" since we do not make use of it. We will just depend on the "Model" for now.
3. Go to the `script.js` file, in the `calculate_value()` function, use basic algebra to simplify the equation that calculates the final car `value` (line 17). The equation does not need all instances of `price` in the equation.
4. Go to the `script.js` file, in the `model_depreceation()` function, in the switch statement, add the remaining car models and their depreciation percentage. I'v added a few models as an example to follow.
